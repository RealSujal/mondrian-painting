# mondrian-painting
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Mondrian painting using HTML and CSS. The painting is made up of three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue) and black lines. The lines are arranged in a grid pattern to create a sense of rhythm and balance.  This project is a great way to learn about the basics of HTML and CSS.
